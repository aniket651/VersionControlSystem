this is an attemp to make a simple version control system called Witness.
Its based on popular vsc "git". Its a fun learning project and has helped me in learning about git internals, object databases and linux filesystems.
This project doesn't use git porceilien and plumbing commands but rather approaches the problem at hand from scatch in NodeJs.

Its in beginner stages only and supports only two commands : initialization and adding to staging area.




To run it :
clone the repo
run npm update
see the index.js file to get idea of the commands u can use.

for eg, if u want to run initialize command, then run "node index.js initialize" in command line.




the method to run will be updated as its currently only in early development phases.
